            <ul>
                <li>
                    <Strong>Contrast:</Strong> When it comes to color contrast arngren does a relatively good job in ensuring that text is visible and problems only occur when text is placed over images. 
                    arngren's size contrast while vast does not work in a cohesive way to make it effective.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Strong>Repetition:</Strong> There is virtually no repetition in this website other than its use of default colors for text without rhyme or reason. The only consistent thing on this website is it's adherance to chaos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Strong>Alignment:</Strong> All the text is left justified but every box is aligned in whatever way it wants creating a collage effect across the whole website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Strong>Proximity:</Strong> Everything in this website is close together. If there are catagories it is not aparent from looking at it.
