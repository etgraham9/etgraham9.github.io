        <ul>
            <li>Your links are correct</li>
            <li>All files and folder names follow the appropriate conventions. Some images load slow but naming is ok.</li>
            <li>The color contrast works well, and follows a consistent theme.</li>
            <li>The site follows CRAP well, the contrast is fine as mentioned earlier, all repeated elements are consistent, there aren't any glaring issues with alignment, and the spacing of everything is nice to look at.</li>
            <li>Page has the required header main and footer as well as a working nav bar</li>
            <li>The header and tab name are also correct and functioning properly.</li>
