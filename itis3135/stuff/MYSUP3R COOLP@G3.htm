    <h1 style="font-family: papyrus;">heres what chat gpt had to say about dogs when i asked it!</h1>
    <p style="font-family: comic sans ms; font-size: xx-large;">okay so like imagine you’re just walking down the street right and suddenly you see this dog but it’s not just any dog it’s like the happiest dog you’ve ever seen like it’s got its tongue hanging out and it’s wagging its tail like crazy and you just know that this dog has never had a bad day in its life and you kinda start wondering what that must feel like because honestly life can be kinda stressful and crazy and you got all these responsibilities and deadlines and stuff and then here’s this dog just living its best life chasing a butterfly or whatever and you start thinking like wow maybe I should be more like this dog just vibing and enjoying the little things but then you remember you got like bills to pay and assignments due and suddenly you snap back to reality but for that one second you kinda felt what it was like to be that dog just pure joy and no worries and honestly wouldn’t that be amazing like just imagine if people could be like that more often but no we got all this complicated stuff in our lives that just keeps piling up and we always gotta be planning ahead and making decisions and stressing over things that might not even matter in a few months but still we do it cause that’s just life and that’s how it is and anyway the dog eventually runs off probably chasing another butterfly or maybe just excited about a random smell on the sidewalk and you just stand there for a second before you keep walking and you kinda smile to yourself cause even though life is hectic sometimes you can still find these little moments that remind you that not everything has to be so serious all the time and maybe just maybe you can learn something from that dog even if it’s just to stop and appreciate the butterflies for a minute before you go back to your regularly scheduled chaos.</p>
