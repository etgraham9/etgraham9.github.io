            <li><b>ITCS-4180 Mobile App Development:</b> This is the first time I’ve gotten to work on mobile devices during my studies so it’ll be fun but definitely looks challenging.</li>
            <li><b>ITIS-3135 Web Based Application Design:</b> I had Professor von Briesen my freshman year and really enjoyed him. I’m hoping I can continue to enjoy him with a much more in depth subject than java 1.</li>
            <li><b>ITSC-3155 Software Engineering:</b> This is a fun class about software engineering, its team and project based so it should be pretty fun.</li>
            <li><b>MATH-4109 History of Mathematics:</b> This is the last class I need to finish my minor but it’s still super interesting to learn about the foundations of math and how we got here.</li>
